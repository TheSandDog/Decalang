# WHY DECALANG?

Dl is a fast language and easy to use since it only has 15 keywords.

Here is a simple code in three different languages including decalang.

**Decalang**

```c
fun add(x,y) { 
  send(x + y); 
}
var x = 23;
var y = 12;

add(x,y);
```

**C**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void add(x,y) { printf(x + y); }

int main(int argc, const char argv[]) {
  var x = 23;
  var y = 12;
  add(x,y);
  return 0;
}
```

**Python**

```python
def add(x,y): 
  print(x + y)
x = 23;
y = 12;

add(x + y)
```
